				"Place the bite-sized cauliflower florets and 1-inch pieces of tofu onto the baking sheet. Drizzle with oil then sprinkle with curry powder and salt. Toss to thoroughly coat. Bake for 20-25 minutes, tossing halfway through. The cauliflower will be tender and golden brown on the outside and the tofu slightly crispy.",
				"KORMA SAUCE: Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large rimmed skillet or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in the curry powder, tomato paste, and sea salt and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. Next add 1/2 cup of water (adjust amount if altering batch size) to deglaze the pan. Stir and cook for about 3 more minutes until the water has reduced slightly.",

				"Pour the contents of the blender back into the pan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.",
				"COMBINE: Once the roasted cauliflower and tofu look crispy, add them to the sauce and reduce for about 5 minutes until the consistency is to your liking (we prefer it to be almost a cheese sauce consistency). Taste and adjust as needed, adding more salt for overall flavor or optional lemon juice for brightness.",
				"We like to serve it over rice with dairy-free yogurt, pickled onions, and cilantro (all optional, but extra delicious!). Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days or in the freezer for 1 month (or longer).",
