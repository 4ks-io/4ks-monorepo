These tutorial followed to implement the media upload feature (https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/uploading-images-directly-to-cloud-storage-by-using-signed-url) points out that "there
are TWO ways to sign the generated bytes to create the Signed URL" and the code sample includes a SignBytes function on the SignedURLOptions.

https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/uploading-images-directly-to-cloud-storage-by-using-signed-url/#:~:text=there%20are%20two%20ways%20to%20sign%20the%20generated%20bytes%20to%20create%20the%20Signed%20URL.

This is very different from the other code sample provided (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/samples/storage-generate-upload-signed-url-v4#storage_generate_upload_signed_url_v4-go) which says there are in fact
THREE ways to sign code.

Signing a URL requires credentials authorized to sign a URL. You can pass
these in through SignedURLOptions with one of the following options:
a. a Google service account private key, obtainable from the Google Developers Console
b. a Google Access ID with iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob permissions
c. a SignBytes function implementing custom signing.

In our code we opted for (b) of the three options. In this approach it isn't necessary define the
custom SignBytes function or provide a private key (the general concensus online seems to be to avoid this
solution). In this approach credentials are automatically detected since the code is on GCE.

What I've discovered is that ...

url, err := client.Bucket(uploadableBucket).SignedURL(key, opts)
ERROR!! SignedURL: storage: exactly one of PrivateKey or SignedBytes must be set

url, err := storage.SignedURL(uploadableBucket, key, opts)
This works...
